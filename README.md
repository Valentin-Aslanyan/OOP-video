Some very simple examples (here, in C++) at the undergraduate level of why Object Oriented Programming is typically slower than Procedural Programming.

**Class_size.cpp** - demonstrates examples of packing, why classes take more memory than classless code.

**Loop1_With_Class.cpp** / **Loop1_Without_Class.cpp** - shows that looping and modifying an array of objects is slower than two separate arrays of primitives.

**Loop2_With_Class.cpp** / **Loop2_Without_Class.cpp** - shows that using an accessor/getter method is slower than accessing class attributes directly.

**Two_Error_Types.cpp** - shows two fundamentally different coding errors.
